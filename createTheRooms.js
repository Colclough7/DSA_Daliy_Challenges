/*Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( dict in Python) called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game.
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties (e.g. name, description, completed).*/

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
 livingRoom: {
        name: "Living Room",
        description: "A cozy room with a fireplace and soft couches. There's a door leading to the hallway.",
        completed: false

    kitchen: {
        name: "Kitchen",
        description: "A spacious kitchen with a stove, fridge, and a locked cabinet. A window leads outside.",
        completed: false
