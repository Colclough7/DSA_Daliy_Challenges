/*You are a data analyst at a prestigious UK university. As part of the university's ongoing efforts to understand student performance and provide effective 
learning support, you've been tasked with analyzing the course scores of students over the academic year 2022-2023. Universities in the UK follow 
a trimester system, with each year split into three terms:

Michaelmas term (Autumn term) - October to December
Lent term (Spring term) - January to March
Summer term (or Easter term) - April to June
Your task is to identify students who have shown consistent improvement in their course scores over the three trimesters. 
The university is particularly interested in these students to understand and potentially replicate their success.

You have access to two tables: students and courses.

students:

| id  | name     | email               |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| 1   | John     | john@example.com    |
| 2   | Sarah    | sarah@example.com   |
| 3   | Robert   | robert@example.com  |
...
courses:

| id  | student_id | course_name | score |  course_date |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| 1   | 1          | Math        | 90    | 2022-10-01   |
| 2   | 1          | Science     | 85    | 2022-10-15   |
| 3   | 1          | Physics     | 92    | 2023-01-10   | 
| 4   | 1          | Literature  | 80    | 2023-04-05   |
...
The students table has records of the students' id, name, and email. The courses table keeps a record of each course's id, the student_id of 
the student who took the course, the course name, the student's score in the course, and the date when the course was completed.

Your query should return the following columns:

student_id: the id of the student
name: the name of the student
trimesters_avg_scores: a string aggregating the average score for each trimester, with each trimester's average score rounded to two decimal places and 
placed in brackets. The trimesters should appear in this order: Michaelmas, Lent, Summer.
consistent_improvement: a boolean indicating whether a student has shown consistent improvement in their scores. 
This should be true if a student's average score in the Lent term is higher than in the Michaelmas term, and their average score in the Summer term is 
higher than in the Lent term.
The results should be ordered by student_id in descending order. The trimester boundaries are defined by the start of the month of the first month of 
the trimester and the end of the month of the last month of the trimester. Only course records where course_date falls within these boundaries should 
be considered for the average calculation for that trimester.

GLHF!

Notes:
For this task, let's assume that each student has taken courses in all trimesters.
The academic year in consideration is from October 2022 to June 2023. Any records outside of this period should be disregarded.
Desired Output
The desired output should look like this:

student_id	name	trimesters_avg_scores	consistent_improvement
20	Mac Erdman DC	Michaelmas (84.14), Lent (85.43), Summer (81.14)	false
19	Lala Bradtke DO	Michaelmas (82.14), Lent (82.43), Summer (83.14)	true
18	Nolan Feil	Michaelmas (80.86), Lent (85.86), Summer (81.29)	false
